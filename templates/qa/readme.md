Put your Q&A Template(s) into this folder. 

My recommendation: 
- Set the Q&A Template to "isAvailableForNewContent" to true
- Create a new page with this template
- Set the Q&A Template to "isAvailableForNewContent" to false
- If you like create a static template with all of your modules or a dnd area. For the purpose of  
  this template it doesn't really matter
